ðŸ‘€  A Junior `Front-end developer`, who loves to get more insight from everyday life. Currently working as a `lead front-end engineer` at [namu-ai](https://namu-ai.com/). I am mainly writing TypeScript and Next.js. Hybrid app is my new challenge. 

ðŸ‘Œ When I work, I value theses: Smooth and considerable UI/UX interaction, web accessibility and productivity for the team.

ðŸ‘‰  Learning and sharing knowledge is awesome. I'm currently building [hannah-as-dev blog season 2](https://hannah-as-dev.vercel.app/) to play with Next.js and other new technologies. This will be enhanced version of these two platforms that I built previously. 
 1) [Korean Blog season 1](https://uiyoji-journal.tistory.com/) (2020.03 ~ 2022.02)
 2) [Portfolio & Resume](https://hannah26hannah.github.io/) (~2022.02)

ðŸ›«  I am a `Korean` native speaker using `English` as a second language. 

ðŸ‘€  Feel free to contact me. I'm open to interesting things. `jeongwon.y.h@gmail.com`

ðŸ§  Currrent new interests : Hybrid App, Next.js and the deeper understanding of TypeScript.


ðŸ’ª Wanna try WebGL if possible.
